Hyped News Amplifier spreads Hacker News messages on the page, or it rates Reddit messages with up to 5 stars, always according to the number of points and comments, conveniently weighted the way you like. At the same time, it preserves news positions on the vertical axis, so that they continue drifting down as they age.

-- PROBLEM --

Hacker News and Reddit sites continuously publish news, which users can read, like, dislike, and comment. As time goes by, all news drift down, so that the first few tens of news are always the freshest. Hyped news drift down quite more slowly, though. 

Whenever you start browsing those sites, thousands of other readers around the world have already determined what news mattered most to them. There are very good chances that those same news matter to you too, but you can't tell them apart at a glance, because hyped and fresh news are all mixed up. Instead, you have to eye-scan all the page once and again, comparing and remembering numbers of points and comments, to find out what you should read first.

-- SOLUTION --

Install Hyped News Amplifier. Then open Hacker News or Reddit in a new tab.

Configuration

Hyped News Amplifier is dead simple. It only needs a number to do its magic. By default the number is set to 50%, meaning that points and comments weigh the same. Open the Options page and customize that number. For example, if you set it to 10% points and 90% comments, then comments will count 9 times more than points.
