[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) news have a position on the page
according to their age, plus some points and comments. Along time, all news inexorably age down and vanish into
oblivion. Unfortunately they move all side by side and you can only tell hyped news apart from ordinary ones by
carefully scanning points and comments, from top to bottom, many times.

Hyped News makes stronger news (with lots of points and comments) stand out by proportionally shifting weaker news to
the right. Given that the list order is preserved, aging works as usual but each time you land the page you can easily
spot the "important" stuff and find your feet.

Feel free to set up the relative weight of points and comments to suit your preferences.
