Hacker News and Reddit news have a position on the page according to their age, plus some points and comments. Along time, all news inexorably age down and vanish into oblivion. Unfortunately, news alignment hides hyped news in a compact forest of ordinary ones and you can tell them apart only by carefully scanning points and comments, from top to bottom, many times in a row before choosing one to read. After reading it, if you get back to the page, you need to scan again many times in a row.

Hyped News Amplifier makes stronger news (with lots of points and comments) stand out by proportionally shifting weaker news to the right. Given that the list order is preserved, aging works as usual but each time you land the page you can easily spot the "important" stuff. Also, given that relative sums of points and comments between news change very little in a fair amount of time, when you get back to the page after a while, you can easily find your feet.

Feel free to set up the relative weight of points and comments to suit your preferences.
