[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) news have a position on the page
according to their age, plus some points and comments. Along time, all news inexorably age down and vanish into
oblivion. Unfortunately news alignment hides hyped news in a forest of ordinary ones and you can tell them apart only
by carefully scanning points and comments, from top to bottom, many times and each time you get back to the list.

Hyped News makes stronger news (with lots of points and comments) stand out by proportionally shifting weaker news to
the right. Given that the list order is preserved, aging works as usual but each time you land the page you can easily
spot the "important" stuff as well as find your feet.

Feel free to set up the relative weight of points and comments to suit your preferences.
