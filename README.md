[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) pages continuously publish news, which users can read, up and down vote, and comment on.


## Problem: What should I read first?

Whenever you browse those pages, there are good chances that other readers around the world have already determined what news matter most (up and down voting, and / or commenting on them), and yet you really can't tell them apart.

Instead, you have to eye-scan all the news in the page over and over, comparing their points and comments, to find out what you should read first.


## Solution: Read news on the left first

Hyped News Amplifier spreads news on the horizontal axis so that you can spot most up voted and / or commented on news at a glance.

On the other hand, it preserves news positions on the vertical axis, so that they continue drifting down as they age.


### Configuration

Hyped News Amplifier is dead simple. It only needs a number to do its magic.

By default the number is set to 50%, so that points and comments weigh the same.

However, you can customize that number from the _Options_ page. For example, you could set it to 10%, which would mean that you consider comments 9 times more important than points.
