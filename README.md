# Hyped News Amplifier

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) pages continuously publish news, which users can read, like, dislike, and comment. As time goes by, all news drift down, so that the first few tens of news are always the freshest. Hyped news drift down quite more slowly, though.


## What should you read first?

Whenever you start browsing those sites, there are good chances that other readers around the world have already determined what news matter most, but you can't tell them apart at a glance, because hyped and fresh news are all mixed up. Instead, you have to eye-scan all the page over and over, comparing news points and comments, to find out what you should read first.


## Hyped News Amplifier shows you what

Either it spreads news on the horizontal axis, or it rates them with 1 to 5 stars, always according to the number of points and comments, conveniently weighted. At the same time, it preserves news positions on the vertical axis, so that they continue drifting down as their respective sites meant to.

### Configuration

Hyped News Amplifier is dead simple. It only needs a number to do its magic. By default the number is set to 50%, so that points and comments weigh the same. Open the _Options_ page to customize that number. For example, if you set it to 10% (points, thus 90% comments), then comments will count 9 times more than points.
